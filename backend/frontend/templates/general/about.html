      <h2>Our Vision</h2>
      <p>1. Our platform intends to provide the users with a friendly interface where they can calculate CarbonFootPrint for their own or their businesses and can get personalised tips and suggestions on how they can reduce it to help save the nature.

        <br>2. Users can also proceed to live an eco friendly lifestyle by getting stuff from our very own marketplace called the EcoStore. Here they could get green alternatives for their daily needs and start living an eco-friendly lifestyle.
        EcoStore would also be a platform to promote Reusability. Here users could list the items that they no longer need but it could be useful to others and sell them to people who are looking to get cheaper alternatives.</br>
        
        <br>3. Awareness among users would be created by providing  quality Blogs on our EcoInfo Blog page. It would help the users learn more about leading a environment-friendly lifestyle and also how they could reduce their CarbonFootPrint and hence help save nature.</br></p>
