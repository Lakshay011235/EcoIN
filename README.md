VirtualEnvironment is suggested. So incase if you dont have a virtual environment
```
pip install virtualenvwrapper
```
Now create a new virtual environment.
In this case I am calling my virtual environment as `VirtualEnv`.
```
python -m venv VirtualEnv
```

If you already have an existing virtual environment then activate it by
```
VirtualEnv\Scripts\activate
```
Navigate to the directory which has `requirements.txt` in it.

In this case it is in backend
i.e `.../EcoIn/backend`
then type

Now install the requirements (this is a one time command, no need to run this again).
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If there is any issue in above step, try the following command to install pillow, and rerun the above command
```
python -m pip install pillow
